# Depth Estimation Using Stereo Images

## Overview

This module implements a depth estimation model using stereo image pairs. By leveraging a custom distance calculation layer, the model accurately estimates object depth from disparity maps, making it ideal for applications in autonomous vehicles, robotics, and 3D reconstruction.
